Custom public chats under posts, private and closed group chats. Stream with filters, direct replies with sub-context flows. Advanced communications for a web project.

== Description ==

We all love chatting and use Telegram, Whatsapp, Facebook Messenger, Discord, Slack.

Why not discuss the contents of websites in the form of chatting?

In modern days we can only use some commenting plugins, but they are poor in features (related to ApeTail, of course).

ApeTail replaces usual comments with an advanced chatting system.

ApeTails has such features:
+ Main public chat room for a web project and custom chat rooms, which can be generated automatically under articles or with the special command by admins.
+ Private chats among users. Put the button titled "Support" on the web page which directs to the private chat room of a concrete person.
+ Twitter-like stream with filters which lets you follow all related messages from many sources.
+ Innovative for chats ability to reply directly to messages, creating individual flows. This brings more structure oriented communication amplifying sub-contexts of a chat.
+ Fast "guest" registration with 1 click (actually it is a full registration as a user, but simplified).
+ Create closed group chats and invite your community members.
+ Notifications everywhere let's keep things alive.
+ Stamping emoticons on messages, like in Discord.
+ Styling appearance of own messages (lets easily to identify who sent a message)
+ Be admin of your host, delegate admin rights which allow to ban and unban users.

ApeTail offers a fixed trigger button with unread messages notification which opens the widget frame on top of the page's content accessing to the main public chat room or to private chat room (maybe to owner's of the web site).

All ApeTail widgets are united to one network. If a user signed up to ApeTail in one web site, they will have their setting on other websites where ApeTail is installed. And, of course, can communicate to users privately who use ApeTail on other web sites and see followed/subscribed chats stream messages from other web sites.

ApeTail may boost discussions of posts contents, because users are able to mention new messages even if they are not on ApeTail's widget of your web site and easily jump to chat rooms related to an article on your web site from everywhere.
